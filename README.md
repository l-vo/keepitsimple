# Keepitsimple

## Goal
This project is a docker container for my Hexo blog "Keep it Simple"

## Deployment
```bash
$ docker-compose up -d
```
This project deploy a nginx server which serve the static file generated by hexo. For run hexo server and create or modify page, you must create a docker-compose.override.yml with the following lines:
```yaml
version: "3"

services:
  hexo:
    build: hexo
    ports:
      - "4000:4000"
    volumes:
      - ./public/:/blog/public/:cached
      - ./source/:/blog/source/:cached
```
Once container(s) is(are) built, you can start/stop it(they) with the following commands:
```bash
$ docker-compose start
```
```bash
$ docker-compose stop
```

## Usage
For launching hexo commands, log into hexo container:
```bash
$ docker-compose exec hexo bash
```

Create a new article:
```bash
$ hexo new "My Title"
```

Generate static files (these files will be available through the nginx container):
```bash
$ hexo generate
```
